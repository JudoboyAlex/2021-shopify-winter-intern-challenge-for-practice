# 2021 Winter Shopify Intern Challenge

I am using this take home assignment to practice whole React ecosystem such as hooks, testing with enzyme or react-test-library and may add redux toolkit. This assignment is way past the deadline so this is for pure practice purpose. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
